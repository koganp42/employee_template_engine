##What It Does
Once the application is installed and the main file is initialized in the command line, a series of prompts will begin. The user is first asked for the name of who will be managing a team of engineers and interns. After inputting their information, the names of the team members, and basic information about them (names, ID numbers, emails, and github usernames or school names for engineers and interns, respectively), an html page displaying the team members will be generated.
